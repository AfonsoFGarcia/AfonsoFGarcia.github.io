If you are like me, tomorrow is just another day. For others, it's a celebration of love. And there's a third kind of people for which it is a day to remember their crappy love life. But it's a day to do something.

Go out and destroy yourself on your bike, stay home watching crappy love comedies with your loved one, drink yourself to an early death. Or don't do either of those and watch the incredibly amazing (and 2 stars rated) *Michael Bolton's Big, Sexy Valentine's Day Special* on Netflix.

If Michael Bolton and Valentine's Day together sounds like a cheesy thing to you, forget about it. It's witty and dirty humour at its best in what can only be described as a critic on this idiotic day. And if you don't believe me, check out the trailer below.

No matter what your plans may end up be, either alone, with friends or with your half, have a great tuesday!
