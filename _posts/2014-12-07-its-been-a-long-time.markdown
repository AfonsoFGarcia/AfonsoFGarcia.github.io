I could start this post by screaming "I'M BACK!" in a similar manner as the one Jeremy Clarkson starts every new season of Top Gear. How idiotic would that be? I mean, I'm not Jeremy Clarkson and this blog is not Top Gear. As a matter of fact, it's far away from being Top Gear.

But yeah, I'm back. My blog rises again from the ashes, like a phoenix that just refuses to die. I have long stopped counting the lifes that this blog had, the names it was called or the domains it was hosted. It has been through more blogging engines that I care to think about. And yet, here it is on a new one, with a new name and in a new host.

As someone once said (who is quite [debatable](http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2014/03/9-albert-einstein-quotes-that-are-totally-fake/)):

> The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

And yet, I'm doing it all again. Not that I haven't defined myself has being insane for the past 4 years. But trying again to blog is my definition of insanity. It always ends in the same place (which is nowhere) and yet I keep trying it. I believe that one day I'll get it right.

So, *Make it Code*, huh? Well, it seems like a nice name and it relates two things I love: programming and Star Trek. And how will this work? Exactly the same as before: when I want to write, I write. Nothing good comes from forcing oneself into doing a thing one doesn't want to do. But if you're doing it the same way as before, why do you think it will work this time? And we're back to insanity. There's no other way to describe it.

Or is there? I've been going through a lot of changes this past few months. I moved out of my parents' house and went to another country (although I still don't know if this will stay this way). I'm starting my master's thesis, which means leaving behind the crazy rhythm of classes and assignments to embrace a different kind of crazyness that I hope that can cause some changes. Maybe, just maybe, in the wake of so many changes, this can work.

But it's time to address the elephant in the room: what am I going to write about? Usually, that's my elephant (because let's face it, nobody cares about it). *Make it Code* makes it seem like it's a blog about science fiction and programmimg. Well, part of it will be. Part of it will be just random stuff. Other part will be my experience abroad. It's about everything and nothing. There, I've said it.

And why should you care? Honestly, I don't know. Is my life that interesting? No, very far from it. Am I such an expert in the fields I write about? Not in a million years. Am I that good looking? Nop, I don't think so (but my grandmother does). Am I that funny? Well, sometimes. And yet people read all kind of idiotic things I write on Twitter. Maybe they'll read extended versions of those idiotic things. Or maybe I am everything that I said I wasn't and nobody told it to me. But this seems an answer provided by a politician who doesn't want to reply to the question, so I'll ask it again. Why should you care? It's up to you to find that out. I'll write about themes that matter to me and my view on them, you'll have to decide if you want to read that or not.

So, what else can I say? Oh, I've had salmon for lunch today and I spent 120 minutes looking at people shaking hands yesterday. No, that doesn't belong to this post, maybe to another one. I think I've said everything I needed to say about my return. And without any promises that would be broken, so that's nice. Let's just finish this here, then.
